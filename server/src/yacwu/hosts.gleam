//// Registry of codex managers, one per host.
////
//// "local" always exists and drives the classic stdio child. Alternative
//// local backends (see `backends`) live alongside it: their managers also
//// start eagerly, each driving its own stdio child on this machine. Remote
//// hosts come from ~/.ssh/config (see `ssh_config`) and get a manager
//// started lazily the first time something addresses them — starting a
//// manager is cheap and does not connect; the connection happens on its
//// first request.
////
//// The registry also keeps the thread→host routing map, rebuilt at runtime
//// from thread listings and creations (yacwu stores nothing on disk), so
//// thread-scoped API calls can omit the host once a thread has been seen.
